## Project Background
Endonucleases, such as Cas-9, interact directly with DNA in target cells, often to induce precise breaks as a first step in altering sequence. Both the binding and cleaving capacities of endonucleases have the potential to increase mutation rates through off-target effects. The evolutionary consequences of carrying an active Cas-9 in eukaryotic cells have not been well characterized, though this is a critical step in improving the design of gene editing tools, such as gene drives. We introduced a Cas-9 based gene drive into yeast clones, and evolved them along mutation accumulation lineages to determine whether the presence of the entire drive and the Cas-9 protein alone can increase the rate of break repair recombination (gene conversion) and de novo mutations.
